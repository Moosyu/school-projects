						The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 2024), officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe Olympiade) and officially branded as Paris 2024, is an ongoing international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 26 July (the date of the opening ceremony) to 11 August 2024 in France, with some competitions starting on 24 July. Paris is the main host city, with events held at 16 other cities spread across Metropolitan France, plus one subsite in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]
					</p>
					<p>
						Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris will become the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the 1908, 1948 and 2012 Games).[5][6] Paris 2024 will mark the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (which in turn marks the centenary of the Winter Olympics), will be the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first French Olympics since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games will return to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Paris 2024 will feature the debut of breakdancing as an Olympic event,[7] and will be the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach.[8] The 2024 Games are expected to cost €9 billion.[9][10][11]
					</p>
					<p>
						The six candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest, Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political uncertainty and deterring costs. Boston surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC in the official US bid. On 27 July 2015, Boston and the USOC mutually agreed to terminate Boston's bid to host the Games, partly due to mixed feelings in the city of Boston. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding a referendum.[12] Rome withdrew on 21 September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties.[13] Budapest withdrew on 22 February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures than necessary for a referendum.[14][15][16]
					</p>
					<p>
						Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June 2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes.[17][18] The International Olympic Committee formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time in 2017, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne.[18] The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to discuss which city would host the Games in 2024 and 2028, and whether it was possible to select the host cities for both at the same time.[19]
					</p>
					<p>
						Following the decision to award the two games simultaneously, Paris was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028,[20][21] enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September 2017.[22]
					</p>
					<h3>Host city election</h3>
					<p>
						Paris was elected as the host city on 13 September 2017 at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru. The two French IOC members, Guy Drut and Tony Estanguet, were ineligible to vote under the rules of the Olympic Charter.[23][24]
					</p>
					<h3>Venues</h3>
					<p>
						Most of the Olympic events will be held in the city of Paris and its metropolitan region, including the neighbouring cities of Saint-Denis, Le Bourget, Nanterre, Versailles, and Vaires-sur-Marne.[25][26]
						The basketball preliminaries and handball finals will be held in Lille, which is 225 km (140 mi) from the host city; the sailing and some football games will be held in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, which is 777 km (483 mi) from the host city; meanwhile, the surfing events are expected to be held in Teahupo'o village in the overseas territory of French Polynesia, which is 15,716 km (9,765 mi) from Paris, the host city. Football will also be hosted in another five cities, which are Bordeaux, Décines-Charpieu (Lyon), Nantes, Nice and Saint-Étienne, some of which are home to Ligue 1 clubs.

					<h3>Medals</h3>
					<p>
						Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the Games logo engraved into it.[30] Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.[31]
						The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal.[32] Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[33] The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.[34]
					</p>
					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
						France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and "facilitate operational information exchange" and "international law enforcement cooperation" during the Games.[35] Within the agreements, it was planned to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the channel illegally.[36] The British Army will also be deploying Starstreak surface-to-air missile units for air security.[37] Police in Paris held inspections and rehearsals within their bomb disposal unit before the Games, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France.[38]
						As a part of Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani's visit to France, several agreements were signed between two nations to enhance security for the Olympics.[39] In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorist measures, Poland has pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety of the Games.[40][41] The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander of Lekhwiya convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 ahead of the Olympics, with officials and security leaders, including Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani to discuss security operations.[42]
						The Lekhwiya were reported to be deployed in Paris on 16 July 2024.[43] It was reported on in July 2024, that police officers from Germany,[44] India,[45] Ireland,[46] Luxembourg,[47] South Korea,[48] Spain, the UAE[49] and the UK will be deployed in Paris to assist their French counterparts with a total of 40 countries providing police assistance.[50][51][52]
						Security concerns impacted the announced plans for the opening ceremony to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[53][54][55][56] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on to the streets of Paris in the lead up to the Games.[57]
