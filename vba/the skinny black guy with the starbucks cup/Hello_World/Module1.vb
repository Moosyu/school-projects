'Religion and politics often make some people lose all perspective and give way to ranting and raving and carrying on like emotional children. They either refuse to discuss it with reason, or else they prefer argumentum ad hominum, which is a hell of a way to conduct a discussion. Well, anyhow, not long ago, I was talking about the elections, and how the campaigns were ignoring the issues, and sticking instead to invective and personal crap that had nothing to do with the substantive problems of running a government, which is all true, as you know if you followed the speeches and so-called debates of the candidates. Anyhow, one of the guys I was talking with said not a word in the whole conversation except at the end when he suddenly chuckled and said we were all full of shit, and why didn't we go live in Russia or China if that was the way we all hated the United States Of America. Next thing you know the whole blooming discussion was more like a brawl, And the epithets flew thick and fast, and the noise was incredible.
