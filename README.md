# vba
vba.net projects that i was forced to make. they vary from very bad to bad as i only had an hour or less per and im just not very good at programming
every project uploaded here has a note (i think) saying what it does and how to make it work. i wouldnt recommend running any of these or copying any code written here. i mean you can if you want but like it probably wont be very good. they are also not named well and are just lyrics from the first song i thought of
